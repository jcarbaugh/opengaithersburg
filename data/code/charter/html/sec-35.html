<p>In case of a vacancy in the office of mayor or councilmen for any reason, a majority of the remaining members of the council shall elect some qualified person to fill such vacancy. The person appointed by the remaining members of the council shall continue in office until the next general election provided no public petition for a special election is received within thirty (30) days of such appointment. A public petition requesting that a special election be held shall contain the signatures of at least twenty (20) percent of the registered voters of the city and must be received within thirty (30) days of an appointment by the remaining members of the council. A special election shall be held within forty-five (45) days from the date that the petition is certified as conforming to the requirements of this section and other applicable election laws and regulations. Where a special election is held, the appointed person shall continue to serve provisionally. In the event that the term of the person originally elected to the office which has become vacant shall not expire at the next general election, then the remainder of that term shall be filled by election at the next general election.</p>
