# Sec. 44 - Disposition of unexpended appropriations at end of budget year.

All appropriations for operating expenses shall lapse at the end of the budget year to the extent that they shall not have been expended or lawfully encumbered. All appropriations for capital expenditures, to the extent that they shall not have been expended or lawfully encumbered at the end of the budget year, shall be deemed to be re-appropriated without inclusion in the budget for the subsequent year unless the council shall specifically provide that such appropriations are not re-appropriated. Any unexpended and unencumbered appropriations for operating expenses shall be considered surplus at the end of the budget year for which they were appropriated and shall be included among the anticipated revenue for the next succeeding budget year.
