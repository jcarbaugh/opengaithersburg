All regular meetings of the council except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of Maryland shall be open to the public and residents of the city shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard at any regular meeting in regard to any municipal question, provided that this shall not be construed to require the council to permit additional evidence in any matter with respect to which the record has been closed. Special meetings may be called by the mayor or the vice president of the council and shall be called by the mayor or the vice president of the council or the city manager upon request of a majority of the members of the council. Such special meetings may, but need not be, open to the public.
