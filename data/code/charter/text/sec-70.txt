# Sec. 70 - Right of city to enter upon county and state public ways.

The city may enter upon or do construction in, on, or over any county or state public way for the purpose of installing or repairing any equipment or doing any other things necessary to establish, operate, and maintain the storm water sewers provided for in this Charter. Unless required by the county, or state, the city need not obtain any permit or pay any charge for these operations, but it must notify the county or state of its intent to enter on the public way and must leave the public way in a condition not inferior to that existing before.
